# Requirements


## Introduction
single axis is just a system that follows the sunlight. by using this system you can make more power collected through the sunlight by the solar system,now the sunset is in the opposite direction so the system will also move with the sun so the system can get the maximum power by the sun tracking..
## Advantages
*	The advantages of solar power that the development of better solar technology is beneficial for areas that otherwise would not be able to access electricity.
## Disadvantages
* Solar doesn’t work at night.The biggest disadvantage of solar energy is that it’s not constant.
* So energy must be stored or sourced elsewhere at night.

# SWOT Analysis
## Strength
* In solar panels make more power to more intensity. that means the solar power converted to electricity is directly proportional to the intensity of light.
## Weakness
* Many solar drip feed batteries available, these are currently costly and bulky, and more appropriate to small scale home solar panels than large solar farms
Solar doesn’t work at night.
## Opportunity
*	Global prices for photovoltaic (PV) modules are dropping, reducing the overall cost of generating solar power.
*	According to one estimates, the combination of electricity demand growth, fossil fuel cost and availability challenges, and supportive environmental regulations could increase solar power capacity.

## Threat
*	Over winter months when there are less sunlight hours and sun radiation is less intense.
## 4 W's and 1 H
### Who
*	The servo motor drive the solar plane by geting the input for microcontroller.
### What
*	Dual axies are used for more comfort.
### When
*	Very effective during summer.
### Where
*	At the rooftop.
### How
*	Tracking tha sun in day time.
